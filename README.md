# CommunityMod
Community Mod. Just for fun.

## How to contribute
1. To contribute to the community mod, all you need to do is fork this repository. 
2. Then you can clone the fork onto your PC so that you have a local version. 
3. Next, you will have to run the generic setup commands that you run when you first create a mod. 
4. When you are finished making the changes you want, commit and push them to your fork. 
5. Finally, make a PR on GitHub that brings the code from your fork into the main repository.

Alternatively, you can do a lot of these steps in your IDE or GitHub Desktop Application.

### How will my PR be accepted?
Your code will be reviewed by one of the Triage Team. If your code is SFW (Safe For Work), does not break the mod, and
does not change the concept or someone else's idea, then the code will be merged. If it breaks any of these it will be
closed. You must also add to this file in the [section below](#whats-included-in-this-mod) for what you have added/modified in your PR. If you do not
supply an edit to this README.md, then you will be asked to add to it. If you continue failing to do so, your PR will be
closed.
